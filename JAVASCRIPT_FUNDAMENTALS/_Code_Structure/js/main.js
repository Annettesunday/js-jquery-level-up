"use strict";

// this code works the modern way


/*
Statements are separated with semi colons
Sometimes if you omit the semicolons, the line break acts as implicit semicolon, but not always
*/


//  This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');
alert('World');  // This comment follows the statement



/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment
*/

alert('Hello');
alert('World')

// Comments do not have negative effects ib production at all


/* Nested multiline comments are not allowed and will cause an error */
